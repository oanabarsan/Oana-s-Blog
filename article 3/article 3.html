        <h1>Dogs vs Cats</h1>

        <img class="dog-and-cat" src="dog and cat.jpg">
        
       <p>Cats and dogs are the most popular pets in the world. Cats are more independent and are generally cheaper and less demanding pets. Dogs are loyal and obedient but require more attention and exercise, including regular walks.</p>

       <h3>How to choose</h3>

       <p>When choosing between a cat or a dog, you should consider how much time you can dedicate to the pet (dogs require more time than cats, and don't like to be left home alone), how much you can afford to spend (dogs are more expensive than cats), and what temperament of pet you would before (dogs are more needy and affectionate than independent cats).</p>

       <p>When choosing a cat, consider whether you want to get a purebred cat from a breeder, or rescue a cat from an animal shelter. If you are not getting a kitten, consider whether you want an indoor or an outdoor cat and choose accordingly, as certain cats will be trained for different situations. Different breeds have different temperaments, but they vary less than dogs. For example, Siamese cats are intelligent and playful, but can be very noisy, while long-haired cats are laid back and short haired cats are usually affectionate and even-tempered. Individual cats also have different personalities, so interact with them before taking them home. Consider the hair length you can handle, as longer fur, such as the fur of a Maine Coon, Persian or Ragdoll, will require daily brushing.</p>

       <p>When choosing a dog, consider its size. Larger dogs, such as a German Shepherd or a Labrador, need more space and cost more to feed and care for. Some breeds, such as Labradors, Corgis and Spaniels, are also easier to train than others, and have more friendly temperaments. Take into account the length of the dog's fur, as those with longer coats will need more regular grooming. Although purebreds are popular, they can suffer from greater temperament and health problems. Mixed breed dogs usually have fewer health problems and can be adopted more cheaply from shelters.</p>

       <h4>Equipment</h4>
       <p>Cats require a food and water bowl, a litter box, a few toys and scratching posts, and a brush for grooming. Dogs require a food and water bowl, a leash and collar, a dog bed, toys and chews and treats.
       </p>

       <h4>Feeding</h4>

       <p>The amount a cat needs to eat varies depending on its size, but cats require less food than most all dogs. Cat food comes in dry or canned wet form. Adult cats require between 250 and 300 calories per day.The amount a dog eats depends on its size. Commercial dog food comes in both dry and wet forms, and most dogs need between 25 and 30 calories per pound per day.</p>

       <h4>Grooming</h4>

      <p>Cats do not need bathing, but they should be brushed regularly if they have long hair.

        Dogs - especially those with long hair - need grooming and bathing frequently.
        
        Both cats and dogs can get infected with ticks, lice, fleas and other pests. When this happens, disinfectants like Frontline or Advantix are required to rid the pets of the infection. Some of these chemicals contain harmful pesticides. Care must also be taken to ensure Advantix is used only on dogs because it is very dangerous for cats.</p>

        <h4>Health</h4>

        <p>The average life expectancy of cats is around 12 to 14 years, but they can live into their 20s or even their 30s. Medical costs for cats are around $160 per year.

        The life expectancy of dogs — usually 7 to 14 years — varies depending on the breed, with larger breeds tending to have shorter lives, akin to the lifespan of wolves. The oldest dog was 29 years old. Medical costs for dogs vary depending on size and existing health conditions but will usually be at least $200 for dental cleanings and vaccines.</p>

        <p>Comparing dogs and cats is like comparing apples to oranges. Each species has its pros and cons, and both are special in their own ways. This age-old battle of dog people versus cat people doesn't really need to continue.

        Can't we all just get along? Cats and dogs can learn to live happily together. Why choose? Just get both!</p>
