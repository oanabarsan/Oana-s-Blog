          <h1>Life with dogs</h1>
        </div>
        
      
      <p>Dogs have been 'our best friend' for millennia and, if you start your relationship off properly, your dog will lead an enriched, fulfilling life, and become a fantastic companion, and a much-loved member of your own family.</p>
      
      
      <div class="company-dog">
      <h2>Choosing the most compatible companion for you and your family
      </h2>
      
      <p>Now you have made the decision to share your life with a dog, you will need to think about which type of dog you feel would best enjoy your lifestyle. This is really important because you and your dog will have to integrate into each other's lives, and whilst you will have to make some compromises, some things, like your accommodation, just cannot easily change.
      
      
      <p>A high-energy breed such as a Springer Spaniel is less likely to enjoy living in a high-rise flat, as they require ample exercise and access to space. Equally, some dogs need a peaceful home environment, and will struggle living with boisterous children. It is important to consider the uniqueness and variations within breeds and individuals, and not just your own preferences.</p>

      <img class="photo-dog" src="photo 4.jpg">
      </div>
      
      <h2>Integrating into each other's lives</h2>
      <p>Bringing a dog of any age into your home will require a period of adjustment - for you, your family, and the dog. Your dog's personal level of confidence will affect their adjustment to these changes therefore they may be anxious or overwhelmed when you bring them home. This initial period is key to getting off to a good start, therefore it is essential to be calm, patient and consistent. Remember that whilst some dogs may adjust very quickly, others may take a few months or more to really relax and settle in.</p>
      
      <p>In general terms, a new puppy has less previous experience and fewer expectations to deal with therefore may adjust quickly. A rescue dog will have come from a previous situation which may have left her/him fearful, anxious, depressed, or simply used to a different set of rules and lifestyle. Giving your new dog as long as they need to adjust in a relaxed, quiet environment will give you all the best chance of creating a healthy relationship for years to come.</p>
      
      <h2>Getting off to a good start</h2>
      <p>Here are some tips to follow to give you and your dog the best chance of a good start:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You will need to devote time to supporting your dog to develop vital life skills, so plan this well in advance. In addition, factor in plenty of quality time for you to exercise, play, and spend time with your dog.</li>
        <br>
        <li>There are several excellent books available on training a puppy. If you can, review the contents of the book before purchasing to make sure that the training methods do not involve being 'dominant' or promote inducing fear or any discomfort unto the dog. These methods are still taught by unregulated 'professionals' and will not allow you to build a healthy, trusting relationship between you and your dog.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Have everything prepared before the dog comes home with you. This involves all the practical things that you need as well as the plan you have formulated with which to meet the needs of your dog alongside your existing routine - at work and at home. </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <h2>Teaching your dog skills</h2>
      <p>You may wish to join a training class.  Make sure the class is reputable and provides the positive dog-centred approach necessary to build your trusting relationship. Classes can be as useful for an older rescue dog as they are for providing puppies with valuable life skills. Classes should provide a safe and structured environment for assessment, learning and socialisation under the supervision of a trained professional.  Dog training classes are not regulated so it is beneficial to go to visit the provider before committing your dog to its care, to explore whether they provide a calm and friendly atmosphere where dogs and their owners can progress together.</p>
      <p>Avoid trainers who use harsh methods, such as dominance or punishment. What the trainer may describe as a firm approach can be a long way from an ethical and encouraging training environment, in which dogs can develop a love to learn through play, praise and reward.</p>
